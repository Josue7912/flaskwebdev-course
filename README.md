# Flask Project: Feedback App

Here you can find the Flask Project of creating an app from CodingNomads online Flask course.

In this project I have created an app which saves customers feedback about the service received from an IT department.

## How to maket it work?

To be able to create an app that records the feedback of a customer and you receive an email notification I used PostgreSQL as database to save all data and Mailtrap (mailtrap.io) as a virtual inbox with a random email address which will send/receive those emails.

The app has been created using VSCode and then got uploaded to Heroku to deploy the app!

### Libraries and Modules I used
